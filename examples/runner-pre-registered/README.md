# Example - Spot Runner - Private subnets

This is the previous default example. For this example you need to register the runner before running terraform and provide the runner token. Since version 3+ the runner can register itself by providing the registration token. This examples is to show case backwards compatibility.

## Prerequisite
The terraform version is managed using [tfenv](https://github.com/Zordrak/tfenv). If you are not using tfenv please check `.terraform-version` for the tested version.
